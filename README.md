# Dimensions
This personal project aims to explore a novel concept by combining 2D and 3D elements in a single game. The player controls two characters: one can manipulate 2D physical objects, while the other can handle 3D physical objects. The main goal is to solve puzzles and defeat enemies to progress through the game. These puzzles require both characters to work together, using both 2D and 3D objects to succeed.
